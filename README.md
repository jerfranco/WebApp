# Overview

For my fifth and final sprint of this semester, I decided to work on a Web Application, specifically a Website Portfolio that other employees can look at. People all around the world use the Internet and they browse many and countless amounts of websites. Websites are crucial in our day. Without it, there will be a lot of problems that the world might have. It is a great tool that we can use to learn more about any topic we desire. 

This Web Application that I built was around React. This is my first time using React, and so far it's great! When the WebApp is ran first cd into App, then npm start the App, it will display my Website Portfolio about me.

The Software that I used is VSCode which is one of the most common programming software that programmers use today!

# Web Pages

The framework that I used for this sprint is React. Because I was using React, I decided to only keep it to a single page but with multiple interactions to allow people to interact with me. The main webpage that is displayed is my website porfolio. It has a little description about me and then three boxes for them to see my work and to get in contact with me.

# Development Environment

One of the tools that I used was to first install React onto my machine and then import React to my program so that it can run. 

# Useful Websites

* [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/)

# Future Work

* One of the things that I will try to do is to make my website portfolio accessible to people. It is still currently on hosted on my local machine, so I will try to figure out ways to let people access it.
